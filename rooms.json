In room dining menu was a bit disappointing and needed some more common items. Breakfast buffet had tonnes of options, but unfortunately in my opinion the quality did not seem up to par letting down the entire illusion of high class luxury.",

Surprisingly 2nd room was better though tariff was less. Kid meals were excellent specially fish and chips and khichdi. During pandemic i would advise to avail in room dining and go for a no meal option while booking. The hotel rooms were kid friendly. Wooden furniture instead of glass furniture. Ample room and spacious. Bathtub good for family. Cons - minibar not operating. Breakfast in ed-en pavilion was highly crowded. Ni servers at buffet points. Everyone taking foods using same spoon."

The hotel has got around three resturants but if u are opting for a package with meal, then you will have to eat cal27 which is am awesome resturant. Food is delicious. Food served both in dinner and breakfast was very good. The hotel staff is very gentle and welcoming. They maintain proper hygene. They provide u with sanitizer, masks, fire exinguisher and sanitized remotes in room. Over all had a very pleasant stay."

The place is run mostly by trainees and very inefficient staffs! If u call for room service at day time they come in the evening! You call for a bell boy they come after an hour! Regarding the buffet spread it was even so haphazord! There were almost 30 ppl present at the east india dinning space where only 3 ppl serving breakfast! We order an alu parantha. believe me we waited for 1.5 hours and got it on the plate wd a sorry that they were late!‚ò∫Ô∏è the property is good n visiting it once is okay!! üòä"

While the spread was mouthwatering, there‚Äôs definite room for improvement when it comes to refilling and swiftness.
